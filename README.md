# StakeTechTest

You have to develop a two page application using the latest Angular you are experienced with- ideally 14 if you have exposure
You can use any online app development platform like Stackblitz to edit/save your code. (Stackblitz would be our preference though :) Brownie points for Stackblitz)
You should be able to run and demonstrate the app in the interview
The default page should display list of Posts with pagination - 10 at time with next and prev buttons. The data should be loaded from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
The default page should have a Input text to filter the posts by userName fetched from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users
when clicked on a post, should load the post details in a new page
User should be able to navigate back from the post detail page via a button.
Minimal default native styles will do but you can use any UI library if you need (like angular material or bootstrap etc).

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
